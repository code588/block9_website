My Personal Website

This is a simple website I created as a project for my web development course. The website contains three pages, an index page, an about page, and a portfolio page. It also includes a JavaScript file and a CSS file.

Pages

    index.html: The home page of the website. It includes a short introduction and a section about the website owner.
    about.html: This page includes information about the website owner's experience and skills.
    portfolio.html: This page showcases some of the website owner's projects.

Files

    website.js: This JavaScript file is used to add social media icons to the footer of the website.
    style.css: This CSS file is used to style the website.
